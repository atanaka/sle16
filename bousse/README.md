## Description

Our artifact folder is divided in two folders:

- `framework-sources` contains all the sources used to build a complete GEMOC studio, which includes the sources of the GEMOC execution framework. The README explains both how to compile a working studio, and which parts of the sources are related to which parts of the framework described in the paper.
- `gemoc-studio` contains an archive with a complete GEMOC Studio. The README explains how to start and play with a GEMOC Studio.
